## Overview

An implementation of a Wallet Provider service according to [OpenId4VCI 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html), 
and [EUDI Wallet Standards and Technical Specifications](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Wallet Provider is created strictly for testing and development purposes.   
> By default, Wallet Provider acts as a **_MOCK_** Wallet Provider service, performing **_NO_** validations of Key Attestations provided by Wallets, 
> issuing Attestations with **_NO_** further checks.    
> Wallet Provider can be **_OPTIONALLY_** configured to perform validations of Key Attestations provided by Wallets, using the 
> [Warden Server-Side Mobile Client Attestation Library](https://github.com/a-sit-plus/warden).

## Disclaimer

> [!CAUTION]  
> Wallet Provider is created strictly for testing and development purposes. It is **_NOT_** production-grade.  
> Wallet Provider is provided on an as-is basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied.

The released software is an initial development release version:

* The initial development release is an early endeavor reflecting the efforts of a short timeboxed period, and by no means can it be considered 
as the final product.
* The initial development release may be changed substantially over time, might introduce new features but also may change or remove existing 
ones, potentially breaking compatibility with your existing code.
* The initial development release is limited in functional scope.
* The initial development release may contain errors or design flaws and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss.
* The initial development release has reduced security, privacy, availability, and reliability standards relative to future releases. This could 
make the software slower, less reliable, or more vulnerable to attacks than mature software.
* The initial development release is not yet comprehensively documented.
* Users of the software must perform sufficient engineering and additional testing to properly evaluate their application and determine whether 
any of the open-sourced components is suitable for use in that application.
* We strongly recommend against putting this version of the software into production use.
* Only the latest version of the software will be supported

## Features

Currently, the service supports issuance of key-bound Wallet Application Attestations according to 
[Specification of Wallet Unit Attestations (WUA) used in issuance of PID and Attestations](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts3-wallet-unit-attestation.md).

### Issuance of key-bound Wallet Application Attestation

To issue a Wallet Application Attestation:

1. The Wallet requests a single-use Challenge from the Wallet Provider
2. The Wallet generates a new Key-Pair and Key Attestation which contains the single-use Challenge provided by the Wallet Provider
3. The Wallet requests a key-bound Wallet Application Attestation from the Wallet Provider
4. The Wallet Provider:
   1. Validates the single-use Challenge
   2. Validates the Key Attestation
   3. Verifies the Key Attestation contains the single-use Challenge
   4. Issues a key-bound Wallet Application Attestation

```

## Technical Details

Wallet Provider uses the [Warden Server-Side Mobile Client Attestation Library](https://github.com/a-sit-plus/warden) for validating Key Attestations.
Android Wallets must use the [Certification Chain provided by the Android Keystore](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-key-attestation).
iOS Wallets must use the [Supreme Attestation Format](https://github.com/a-sit-plus/warden?tab=readme-ov-file#ios) which is based on [Apple's App Attest Service](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/establishing-your-app-s-integrity).

## Endpoints

An OpenAPI specification of the endpoints provided by Wallet Provider is available [here](openapi/openapi.json).

## Deployment

Wallet Provider can be deployed using Docker or any other OCI compliant container runtime. You can find the available container images 
[here](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-srv-wallet-provider/pkgs/container/eudi-srv-wallet-provider).

### Configuration

Wallet Provider can be configured using the following environment variables:

#### Server configuration

#### Attestation Signing Key Configuration

By default, Wallet Provider uses an ephemeral EC Key on the `secp256r1` curve to sign Attestations using the `ECDSAwithSHA256` algorithm.
